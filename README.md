# Loud List Web App

Rebuilding the web app again. 3rd time's a charm.

Problem: Legacy app doesn't even work as deployed right now [here](http://loudlist.us). Libraries are old. Datepicker doesn't even work.

Solution: Rebuild with: 
  * latest version of react, 
  * react-router,
  * probably styled-components
  * Build client FIRST.
  * Backfill data, server impl, etc, later

Design-challenges:
  * Try doing it without Redux (seriously)
  * Scrape Event data from FB (6 venues worth)
  * Create crazy fast data-entry forms, and see how long it takes to enter event data by hand (seriously)
  * Commission a legit, professional logo


NOTE: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
