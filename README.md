# Loud List Web App

Rebuilding the web app again. 3rd time's a charm.

Problem: Legacy app doesn't even work as deployed right now [here](http://loudlist.us). Libraries are old. Datepicker doesn't even work.

Solution: Rebuild with: 
  * latest version of react, 
  * react-router,
  * probably styled-components
  * Build client FIRST.
  * Backfill data, server impl, etc, later



NOTE: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
